# kernel
Kernel Is a Flask Command Line Tool

#How To Use It

1. 'python kernel <appname>' to create a flask app with basic flask configuration
2. 'python kernel -about' to get details about your kernel version
3. 'python kernel <appname> -pro' to create a flask app with production flask configuration like the app.wsgi file and db configs
Though database configs would be added on the 30 of july unfailingly to both basic and production flask configurational files

Thumbs Up.....
